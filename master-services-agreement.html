MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT

1. Definitions
"Provider" means Proof Group Capital Management LLC that offers the Services.
"Client" means the company or other legal entity identified on an Order that purchases Services from Provider.
"Agreement" means, collectively and in order of precedence: (a) the applicable Order Form(s); (b) this Master Services Agreement ("MSA"); (c) the Service Level Agreement ("SLA"), if any; and (d) Provider’s Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Policy, and other policies referenced herein (collectively, "Policies").
"Services" means the features, functionality, and other services ordered by Client under an Order.
"Content" means any data, software, or other information transmitted to or from, stored on, or processed through the Services by Client or its end users.
"Aggregated Data" means technical or operational data derived from Provider’s operation of the Services that is anonymized and aggregated so that it does not identify Client or any individual.
"Order" means a mutually executed order form or quote (including any schedules or SOWs) that describes the Services, pricing, and Term.
“Uptime” means the percentage of time during a calendar month that the Services are available and operational.

2. Governing Documents and Obligations
2.1 Governing Documents. Each Order constitutes a separate Agreement and incorporates by reference the documents listed in the definition of Agreement.  In the event of conflict, the Order controls, followed by this MSA, the SLA, and then the Policies.
2.2 Account Security. Client is solely responsible for the security, backup, and integrity of its Content and credentials. Provider disclaims all liability for unauthorized access unless caused solely by Provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Client is responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under Client’s account whether by authorized or unauthorized users.
2.3 Support & Availability. Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver support and availability in accordance with the Order.

3. Term; Fees; Taxes
3.1 Term. The term of each Order ("Term") begins on the Effective Date specified in the Order and continues for the committed period, automatically renewing for successive like periods unless either party provides written notice of non‑renewal at least thirty (30) days before the then‑current Term ends.
3.2 Fees & Payment. Client will pay all fees described in each Order.  Unless otherwise stated, fees are invoiced monthly in arrears and due net thirty (30) days from invoice date.  Provider may suspend the Services for late payment after providing at least five (5) days’ prior notice. Provider reserves the right to adjust pricing for Services.
3.3 Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes. Client is responsible for all sales, use, VAT, or similar taxes (other than taxes on Provider’s net income).
3.4 Usage-Based Billing. For Services with usage-based components (bandwidth, storage, compute resources), Client will be billed according to actual usage as measured by Provider's systems. Usage charges may vary based on geographic regions, time of use, or resource type as specified in the Order.
3.5 Suspension. Provider may suspend Services for: (i) non-payment after notice; (ii) violation of the Agreement or Policies; (iii) potential security or operational risks; or (iv) legal requirements. Suspension may result in loss of service availability and data. Client remains responsible for fees during suspension periods.

4. Service Level Agreements. Provider guarantees 99.9% Uptime for the Services each calendar month. Scheduled maintenance (with 24 hours notice) and downtime due to force majeure events are excluded from Uptime.

5. Termination
5.1 For Convenience. Either party may terminate an Order for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, in which case the Order will terminate at the end of the current Term.  Client may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if Provider fails the Service Level Agreements. Fees are non‑refundable.
5.2 For Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement or an Order immediately upon written notice if the other party (a) materially breaches the Agreement and fails to cure within fifteen (15) days after notice, or (b) becomes insolvent or commences bankruptcy proceedings, or (c) violates applicable laws or regulations.
5.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, Client must cease use of the Services and remove all Content. Provider may delete Content after this period. Sections that by their nature are intended to survive (including 3.3, 4.3, 5‑11) shall survive termination.

6. Proprietary Rights
6.1 Client Content. Client retains all rights in its Content.  Client grants Provider a non‑exclusive, world‑wide license to host, transmit, and process Content as necessary to provide the Services and to improve Provider’s services.
6.2 Provider Materials. Provider and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in the Services, software, hardware, documentation, Aggregated Data, and any derivatives thereof. All Provider intellectual property rights are reserved.
6.3 Restrictions. Client shall not: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Services; (ii) use the Services for any unlawful purpose or in violation of the Policies; (iii) interfere with or disrupt the Services; or (iv) attempt to gain unauthorized access to Provider's systems.

7. Confidentiality
Each party ("Receiving Party") shall keep confidential all non‑public information disclosed by the other party ("Disclosing Party") that is marked or reasonably should be understood to be confidential.  Confidential Information excludes information that is: (i) publicly available without breach; (ii) known to the Receiving Party without restriction prior to disclosure; (iii) independently developed without use of the Disclosing Party’s information; or (iv) rightfully obtained from a third party without confidentiality obligation.
8. Warranties; Disclaimers
Provider warrants that it will provide the Services in a professional manner.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.
9. Limitation of Liability
9.1 Limitation. Provider’s aggregate liability arising out of or related to the Agreement will not exceed the amounts paid by Client to Provider under the Order giving rise to the claim during the twelve (12) months preceding the event.
9.2 Exclusion. Provider is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits or revenue, even if advised of the possibility except in cases of Provider’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

10. Indemnification
Client shall indemnify and hold the Provider harmless from third-party claims arising from: (a) Client’s material breach of this Agreement; (b) Client’s violation of law; (c) Client’s infringement of intellectual property rights; or (d) Client’s negligent acts or omissions. This obligation excludes claims arising from the indemnified party's gross negligence, willful misconduct, material breach, or unauthorized modifications.

11. Compliance with Law
Each party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its performance and use of the Services, including export control and sanctions laws. Client warrants it will not use the Services for any unlawful purpose.

12. Force Majeure
Neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, government actions, internet or telecommunications failures, or other force majeure events. The affected party must promptly notify the other party and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact. If a force majeure event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either party may terminate the affected Order upon written notice.

13. General
13.1 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. This Agreement is governed by the laws of New York, excluding its conflict of laws rules.  Any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in New York City, New York.
13.2 Assignment. Neither party may assign the Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent, except to an affiliate or in connection with a merger or sale of substantially all assets.
13.3 Entire Agreement; Amendment. The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and may be amended only by a written instrument executed by both parties.
13.4 Notices. Notices must be in writing and deemed given when delivered by recognized overnight courier or certified mail to the addresses set forth on the Order.
13.5 Updates. Provider may update this MSA and Policies from time to time with thirty (30) days' notice. Continued use of Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
13.6 Relationship of the Parties. The parties are independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship. Neither party has authority to bind the other or to incur obligations on the other's behalf without prior written consent.
