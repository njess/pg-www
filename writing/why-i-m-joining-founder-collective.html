<p>> <em>“No matter who you are, you need…somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong — when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call.”</em> -Ben Horowitz, The Hard Thing about Hard Things.</p>

<p>I’ve had the joy and privilege to spend the last seven years building early stage  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology">technology</a>  companies. I’ve raised close to $10M, sold a company, and when I needed to use my “one call,”  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/founder">Founder</a>  Collective’s phone would ring. And they always answered. Why did they answer, you may ask?</p>

<p><em>To protect their large investment stake?</em> They weren’t investors.</p>

<p><em>To win an allocation in your financing round?</em>  They didn’t see my first company, and chose not to invest on my second.</p>

<p>So, why? Because they’d been through their own entrepreneurial journeys. And seen a thing or two. But most of all: I believe it’s because <a href="http://www.foundercollective.com/founders">Eric, David and Micah</a>  genuinely care.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/founder-collective-easily-finds-75-million-for-fund-three/">venture fund they’ve built</a>, Founder Collective, is guided by a simple mission “To be the most aligned fund for founders at the seed stage.” This is what that means to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Be the most helpful investor any founder has.</li>
<li>  Stay aligned with the founders (spiritually and structurally).</li>
<li>  Dilute with them as the company grows.</li>
<li>  Be (and stay) lean.</li>
<li>  Be (and stay) humble. It’s harder on the other side of the table.</li>
<li>  Know that VC isn’t the right answer to every question — it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/16/venture-capital-is-a-hell-of-a-drug/">a hell of a drug</a>.</li>
<li>  Entrepreneurial success  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/theres-no-shame-in-a-100m-startup/">does not always mean IPO</a>.</li>
<li>  Don’t chase themes. Follow the visionary entrepreneurs to the weird and wonderful.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Founder Collective, nothing is off limits. Hard tech? (Cruise) Odd marketplace? (Uber) Regulated market? (Pill Pack) Totally new business? (BuzzFeed). They <a href="http://www.foundercollective.com/collective">do it all</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like a pretty simple premise. But off the record, behind closed doors…I’ve spoken to enough fellow founders to say with conviction: this approach is surprisingly rare.</p>

<p>So it’s with great delight that I tell you that  <strong>I’m joining Founder Collective</strong> as their fifth member of the investment team. I’ll be based in their San Francisco office, where I’ll be investing in and being of service to the next wave of entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>And if you’re an early-stage company founder, I’ll say the following:</p>

<p>I haven’t IPO’ed a company or three. I’m not old enough to have decades of valley “seasoning.”  What I can offer is simple: I’ve lived the struggle.</p>

<p>And I believe more than ever in technology’s power to shape our world in extraordinary ways. I leave the imagination to you — and can’t wait to see what you build.</p>
