<h1>Growth Roles — When to Say “Yes” or “No”?</h1>

<p><em>Originally published on <a href="https://news.greylock.com/growth-roles-when-to-say-yes-or-no-5394b56f8b55">news.greylock.com</a></em></p>

<p>This question was posed to the Greylock  <a href="http://www.greylock.com/communities/#growth">Growth Community</a>  — one of the best private groups of growth, marketing, and data professionals in the Bay Area. Here’s what some of the leaders in growth (folks from Facebook, Pinterest and Dropbox, to name a few) had to say on the matter to a colleague weighing their next gig.</p>

<h2>Company Fit</h2>

<p><strong>1. Meet every single executive and VP individually.</strong>  You’ll be a very important hire and they should make the time. Your goal is to figure out if there’s alignment about how to move the company forward — and especially about what the current challenges are.  </p>

<p>Is the CEO or VP Product willing to unsilo the organization and actually create a dedicated growth team for you? Or will ‘growth’ just be an initiative reporting into functional areas. This is a very important distinction — and some members noted a lack of autonomy as a major red flag.  </p>

<p>If you would roll up into Product or Marketing — make sure you understand what parts you will own that are distinct.  </p>

<p>Another thing to feel out — how do decisions get made? How is prioritization handled? If you identify and tackle a big lever for growth — will you be able to get the resources (people, product changes, capital, engineering time) to actually make an impact?</p>

<p><strong>2. Figure out who owns what metrics.</strong> Does everyone have clear KPIs? For both the company as a whole  <em>and</em>  their unit? This a time when you may unearth fiefdoms and other areas of misalignment. Most of all, figure out who will have to let their metrics suffer for the growth of the company to prosper.</p>

<p><strong>3. Calibrate expectations.</strong> There’s no such thing as a free lunch — and it’s important to make sure that your arrival won’t herald free, limitless “viral” growth or runaway word-of-mouth marketing. It’s a hard process, and you need to make sure that the expectations on you will be realistic.  </p>

<p>If paid acquisition is going to be core to the growth process — do figure out if the company knows it’s customer lifetime value, and is prepared to budget meaningful dollars to learning how to do scalable paid user acquisition.  </p>

<p>Also worth calibrating in today’s financial markets: what growth is the board expecting? (And willing to fund?)</p>

<p><strong>4. Ensure you have the backing of the CEO/founders.</strong>  As one member noted:</p>

<p>> “You are going to have to break a little glass with the way things were traditionally done, and  <em>good CEOs/founders will know and understand</em>  that.”</p>

<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*mjbI8grrqyRfTSI2P4Ujtg.jpeg" alt="" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>During the recruitment process, you should explicitly hear the CEO/founders say that they want someone to come in, work on growth, and bring a new edge.</p>

<h2>Your Fit</h2>

<p><strong>1. Identify the company’s primary core channel of growth</strong> (there’s usually a clear primary one).  Is this in your skill set? Are you going to hit the ground running and be successful? One member notes: “For example, I do better with paid growth. Growth by product is hard.” A business growing by paid influencer marketing is very different than one that grows by careful product invite flow optimization.  </p>

<p>Also, there’s a big difference in the day-to-day at companies that are focused on user-based growth vs. revenue-based growth. Some companies may actually work on both — which may be of interest. Find out which way it is — and weigh whether this is a good fit for you.  </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>  <strong>Decide whether the company’s growth stage is a good fit.</strong> Are you better in the early, uncertain days? Or better at going from $10M to $100M in revenue?</p>

<p>Know the stage of company you may be best at — and be mindful of how the challenges are dramatically different at 20, 75, and 200-person companies.</p>

<p>Members also noted that:</p>

<p>> “Pre-product-market-fit company shouldn’t be hiring a growth executive at all.”</p>

<p>But do note — this happens somewhat frequently. If you’re the first marketing/growth hire, go in eyes-wide-open. You’re here to be quantitative, smart, and scrappy — not work miracles.  </p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>  <strong>Make sure it’s a product you could love — and evangelize</strong>. This is the #1 piece of advice from the group. If you don’t love it (or could grow to love it), making 100 different versions of the same ad may tire quickly. The earnestness you have for spreading a great product will shine through in everything that you do.  </p>

<p>One member noted: “It’s probably obvious to say this, but I’ve been surprised in the number of times I’ve met people [who didn’t love what the company made] but they thought they could just grow the product.”  </p>

<p>If the company has built a product that you can love — and has a real commitment to continuing to improve and grow the product — it increases the odds of your success.</p>

<p>Last but not least…</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Don’t over analyze.</strong> Do know the stage of company where you thrive. Do focus on channels you enjoy (or want to learn). But most of all — pick a great product, gather as much info as you can, and trust your gut.</p>
