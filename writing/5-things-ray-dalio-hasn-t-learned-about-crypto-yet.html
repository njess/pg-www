<p>“Bitcoin today you can't make much transactions in it. You can't spend it very easily."</p>

<p>That's what <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/ray-dalio/">Ray Dalio</a>, founder of mega hedge fund Bridgewater, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/19/ray-dalio-says-bitcoin-is-bubble.html">had to say</a> about crypto last month. He went on to say:</p>

<p>> "It's not an effective storehold of wealth because it has volatility to it, unlike gold [...] Bitcoin is a highly speculative market. Bitcoin is a bubble."</p>

<p>These remarks (as well as a recent <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/12/jamie-dimon-beats-up-on-bitcoin-says-its-a-fraud/">barrage on the topic</a> by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon) got me excited.</p>


<p>Excited because the very people who have built modern “Big Money” don't understand the power that crypto is unleashing around the world. What’s being built isn’t a new area of finance—it’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/spencerbogart/2017/09/26/bitcoin-ethereum-and-the-parallel-world-of-crypto-finance/#384c4d4335e5">entirely new parallel replacement</a>.</p>

<p>So Ray, Jamie—these are the highlights of crypto that opened my eyes to what may be coming. And now I can hardly look away.</p>

<p>Some ground rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>  It's not new money—don't bring the biases you have tied to government-issued currency—it's something far more powerful.</li>
<li>  Remember: it's still extremely early. In Internet terms, recall the days of the 14.4 KB/s modem. We can squint and begin to imagine Netflix playing on a iPhone, but we are still very far away.</li>
<li>  No one knows where this leads (this author included) — but it's important to understand why this is like nothing before.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. What the internet is for information, blockchain tech is for transactions.</strong></p>

<p>This is important. The Internet is, at it’s core, a series of protocols that allow people—who have no prior relationship—to move data back and forth. This goes from low-level things like semi-structured text all the way to streaming 360-degree video. But as soon as the smallest snippet of text was transferred, everything else could follow.</p>

<p>What the internet also did—that wasn’t really possible in the previous world of proprietary machine data connections—was provide smart linkage between content. Example primitives here include embedding a photo and linking to a different web page.</p>

<p>How does this apply to transactions?</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s key “academic” revelation was the first practical solution to a long-standing (since 1982) problem—called the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Byzantine-Generals-Problem.pdf">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>.</p>

<p>This problem is as follows:</p>

<p>Several armies surround a castle they are going to attack. Each army faction is led by a general. However, they must all attack simultaneously to ensure success. It doesn’t matter what time they attack, so long as they agree.</p>

<p>Since they are spread out, it makes communication unreliable. If two attack times were proposed, some generals might hear a different one first. And worse, some of the generals are traitors, and may relay an incorrect message (wrong attack time or similar) to the other generals.</p>

<p>So how can the generals ensure a coordinated attack?</p>

<p>In Satoshi's (the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin) <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09997.html">own words</a>:</p>

<p>> They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its hash. The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of them all working at once before one of them finds a solution. Once one of the generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work in the hash they're working on. If anyone was working on a different attack time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.</p>
<p>> </p>
<p>> After two hours, one attack time should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time. They had to all have seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.</p>

<p>If you are new to crypto: a “hash” is basically a fingerprint—a secure, repeatable reduction of information. Imagine I send you a file via an insecure channel. Someone could tamper with the file. But if I’ve told you (offline, or another secure channel) what the “hash” is, then you can check to make sure the file arrived without tampering.</p>

<p>With the solution for the Byzantine Generals in hand, “Money” as we know it is the easy demonstration app to build—akin to transferring plain text between computers in Internet terms.</p>

<p>Bitcoin may not be the platform that captures much of the innovation yet to come, but it’s clearly benefitting from the network effects of being the first real-world deployment that demonstrates the power of this technology.</p>

<p><strong>2. Never before could anyone build a monetary “country.”</strong></p>

<p>Our locally-issued currency (“fiat” for short) is a relatively fragile, modern invention. We don't have to look very far into history to see how this method may well be ill suited for our future.</p>

<p>Consider the Bretton Woods Agreement — named for international conference held in a New Hampshire town of the same name in 1944, at the end of WWII. In short, the agreement was that countries may set their own interest rates, so long as they <em>artificially constrained and fixed exchange rates</em> between each country.</p>

<p>Why? The goal was for countries to have sufficient yield in capital to rebuild war-torn Europe. If currencies were to be fluid, all the capital would go to the economy with the highest real yields (and likely be unavailable for lower-return, but still necessary projects.) The IMF and World Bank were established to finance shortfalls across member countries.</p>

<p>But differences in inflation rates went on to rip this agreement apart by the beginning of the 1970s. Even at the size of nations, it's hard to keep anything static in markets. Even after further recalibration, the subsequent floating exchange rates put in place led to rampant inflation in the ‘70s.</p>

<p>In our modern age—with unlimited information and entirely geographically dispersed organizations—why would any organization tie themselves to their geographically-proximate neighbors? Ask anyone who has managed payrolls across currencies: it's an entirely different risk.</p>

<p>Now with crypto, anyone—whether a company, a protocol, a network (think EBay buyers and sellers)—can create their own monetary country. This new country's value, relative to more-commonly-traded-counterparts, may experience significant amounts of volatility.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter that Bitcoin's transactions aren't scalable: you don't have to carry only one physical currency to the global markets.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter that it's highly volatile, relative to fiat currency: you will seamlessly be able to convert value to the economic “country” where you need to spend it. Some of these countries (maybe even Bitcoin itself) will eventually become incredibly stable. (Or maybe a monetary country will emerge that provides a simple future yield contract, with desired stability characteristics.)</p>

<p>Some of these “new countries” may badly draw their own borders and be unsustainable or disastrous. Existing nations may be hostile—and attempt to seize or shut down smaller crypto countries. As the Bitcoin project itself has shown—internal politics and inability to move quickly might be huge challenges within these projects. Regardless of an individual ecosystem’s success or failure, this is a new power we've never seen or experienced at scale.</p>

<p><strong>3. It's a currency. It's access to the network. And it's equity in the project.</strong></p>

<p>With the “real” rates (interest minus inflation) stuck at nearly zero for so long, there's just too much money seeking return. I've written before <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tokens-at-the-gate-what-happens-after-the-icos-5cd013f37782">about the ICO phenomenon</a> and the incredible volume (relative to VC as a whole) that is rushing into the system.</p>

<p>At the core: the flexibility of the token system is allowing market demand for non-zero interest returns to seep into new technology projects.</p>

<p>So what’s an ICO? Answer: it totally depends.</p>

<p>The closest parallel I've been able to find is the earliest days of stocks in the industrial era. This was a time before anything was standardized. No Sarbanes-Oxley. No agreement over what “Vanilla” terms meant.</p>

<p>If we look back to the Robber Barons for inspiration (great <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0156767902/ref=cm<em>sw</em>r<em>cp</em>api_VzbRzbX5HFTYS">biography</a> on subject—discovered via Larry Ellison's recommendation), there was a simple playbook for profit:</p>

<p>Take over a small company to be able to have control to issue convertible debt. Drive up the price with affiliates. Convert debt you've issued into now-more-valuable equity. Seize control of operations or dump new equity on the market (depending on your plans). Corporate governance was such a mess—so early that there was no real controls over who, when, and how more stock could come onto the market</p>

<p>This brings us back to ICOs. There are no standards yet. No rules. Now, with the magic of “programmable money.” So an issuer can make up all the rules to their liking.</p>

<p>One could sell you stock/token with a 10 year lockup. Then use the price you paid to mark it up for people with a shorter lockup. And issue new stock/tokens all the way, dumping into the market before you have liquidity.</p>

<p>One could carefully distribute 85% of all tokens ever to be made to many people who now have incentive to help build, populate, and use a network.</p>

<p>One could raise a bunch of speculative money for a network that does not yet exist. See failed Kickstarters in early days for a view into this.</p>

<p>All of these might be called ICOs. (And the SEC certainly has opinions that are still early in being formed and/or made public.)</p>

<p>When built and structured correctly, ICOs may accelerate technology development faster than has ever been possible—attracting investors, ecosystem contributors, and future customers all at once. Skin in the game matters. As the saying goes “no conflict, no interest."</p>

<p><strong>4. Speculation is fundamentally more important than ever.</strong></p>

<p>Many folks are concerned about the amount of speculative capital flooding into crypto projects. While I question is there is a sufficient supply of to-be-successful projects to absorb the total amount of capital seeking access, I don't question the role of speculation.</p>

<p>Speculation is actually more important than ever before in crypto.</p>

<p>To expand on this point a bit - speculation is a key driver of the virtuous cycle / endogenous loop that creates network effects for crypto.</p>

<p>This loop is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Step 1. Any evidence that token price may appreciate (due to business conditions, good things, trends, etc), causes fiat-insensitive network members to hold token vs fiat. (And speculators to purchase marginal-trade willing producers)</li>
<li>  Step 2. Step 1. causes a decrease in the overall token supply, which increases fiat exchange prices</li>
<li>  Step 3. The increased fiat conversion rate causes network participants to bring on additional capacity to the network (increased mining, if you will)</li>
<li>  Step 4. Step 3 makes the network more valuable, which leads to Step 1. repeating</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto engineers and entrepreneurs will build new monetary countries—some with higher returns than you can find anywhere else—and attract the capital and builders to their networks. Crypto will flow into every sector of the economy.</p>

<p>Just as we trade and speculate on energy and food (as well as most other things that make modern life possible), expect speculation to attract significant risk capital to build these new specialized monetary countries. Wall Street firms (or their successors) may one day trade all kinds of things we'd never imagined. (Compute power, storage, bandwidth are a few likely early categories.)</p>

<p>It's early. It's chaotic. It's far from the stable. There's probably a short-term correction coming. But the risk capital keeps rushing into the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The most important applications may look like nothing we can even imagine here, today in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>5. Crypto technology may be more destabilizing to governments than the Internet ever could be</strong></p>

<p>The Internet, while allowing anyone to publish and have a voice, still was constructed in a centralized fashion. Centralization in the telco companies that laid the fiber to carry the writing. Centralization around the platforms to find, discover, and follow writing (and its authors).</p>

<p>When augment a network with the ability to transfer economic value, much of this centralization can be stripped away. Just look to the current events in the Catalan region of Spain—where the people are using <a href="http://la3.org/~kilburn/blog/catalan-government-bypass-ipfs/">censorship-resistant peer-to-peer software</a> to organize a referendum for its independence.</p>

<p>In Silicon Valley, it's well known that future power can come from uncertain and unlikely places. Now, we will watch this dynamic play on the world stage—and it may topple countries and empires along the way.</p>
