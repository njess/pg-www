<h1>The Conservation Of Centralization</h1>

<p><strong>Liquidity, Lock-in, and Cognitive Load: The Limits of Decentralization</strong></p>

<p>All the rent seeking and corruption that plagued centralized systems before the advent of crypto is trying to reassert itself —It’s just winding up in new places. I posit there is “conservation of centralization” in these new systems:</p>

<p><em>For every element of a man-made system that is made decentralized, an equal amount of centralization must be redistributed within adjoining systems.</em></p>

<p>Let’s explore a few examples:</p>

<p><strong>Exchanges</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of how free and open the asset you transact is, you are best served going to the marketplace with the most depth (thus the best prices.) That’s why exchanges have become the most lucrative piece of the crypto ecosystem to date.</p>

<p>We were promised a decentralized utopia of thousands of coins—but for new tokens and assets to get distribution and adoption, they must first make it to the exchanges. Reportedly, some exchanges <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges-listing-tokens-cost-fees-ico-2018-3">will charge as much as $1 million</a> for the privilege.</p>

<p>Will the exchanges of today be the ultimate arbiters of taste and success?</p>

<p>Browse to AOL keyword “uncertain” for the answer.</p>

<p><strong>Blockchains</strong></p>

<p>Ethereum had a remarkable 2017. It’s the platform most developers choose to build on—not because Solidity is good, but because it has the largest ecosystem of development activity. This activity has created all the edge things necessary to make a project really work: <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27048/comparison-of-the-different-testnets">testnets</a>, <a href="https://etherscan.io/">blockchain explorers</a>, <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">wallet experiences</a>, <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">gas price predictors</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Without much imagination, we can see that the Ethereum dev experience will improve the most rapidly—simply because the most smart people are working on it. Not just large token holders—it’s the starting ground for new distributed systems talent getting started.</p>

<p>Will there eventually be a better ecosystem to build smart contract like functionality? We hope it will improve. But for now, the waves of Ethereum-compatible smart contract “SDKs” are coming to market.</p>

<p>The same dynamics are playing out, albeit at a smaller scale, in other projects. New layer one technologies (the blockchains and derivatives handling the permissionless consensus) are really in a race to become the canonical place for developers to start new things. Many higher-scalability projects are being attempted, but this developer lock-in remains a huge hurdle to success.</p>

<p><strong>Ecosystem Connectivity</strong></p>

<p>More than 1 million users already have a <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> extension installed—maybe with enough ETH to try out a new DApp or two. Wallets are set up and already work with all the major hardware wallets. <a href="https://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> can confirm (usually at least) that transaction for new projects are being confirmed, but only if they are built on Ethereum.</p>

<p>Most interestingly perhaps—major exchanges are already integrated with the most common blockchain architectures. The resource “cost” to integrate another ERC20 token is minimal. Are there better economic models a new layer-one project could use? Certainly. But at the cost of adding friction on distribution.</p>

<p>While I’ve just mentioned a few, all these ecosystem connectivity players add significant friction—faced by all new currencies and projects.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive load on users</strong></p>

<p>Many of the forces above might as well look like (web 2.0) “network effects” —particularly for the most successful coins and projects. Therein lies yet another point of centralization: the benchmarks in token owners’ heads.</p>

<p><a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">Coinmarketcap.com</a>  cracked Alexa’s list of top 500 sites in 2017 and set the precedent that crypto asset performance should be measured in USD and BTC. Someday, common interfaces may have many-to-many ways to display returns. But just as the US Dollar and Gold remain, well, gold-standards in a world with many government issued currencies—being the ruler of measurement may establish/enforce what the benchmarks are in this new economy.</p>

<p><strong>Investors</strong></p>

<p>One thing isn’t playing out as we extreme decentralization proponents hoped—we’ve sadly gone further and further away from a more egalitarian vision of project funding, where every dollar is equal.</p>

<p>There were moment of deep question in the investment community. Consider Brave’s ICO, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/brave-ico-35-million-30-seconds-brendan-eich/">sold out more than $30 million</a> of tokens in just 30 odd seconds. I was among the many watching live, astonished at how quickly this egalitarian world might be scrubbed away. Many began to wonder if the new world order would be simply deepest pockets win.</p>

<p>But the current state looks all too much like it did before (and does traditionally in equity finance). There’s lots of money in play. Entrepreneurs quickly discovered that they can maximize their future access to capital by getting branded money to start. Now with liquid markets happening faster than ever before, this “centralization” of capital actors is more pronounced than before.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>As Jim Clark (co-founder of Netscape) has famously <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-succeed-in-business-by-bundling-and-unbundling">said</a> there are “only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is unbundle.”</p>

<p>Projects, like Ethereum, unbundle permission layer. They create an ecosystem where many can build their projects and businesses without fear of central authority (see Twitter’s early dev relations for a vivid example of this fear).</p>

<p>Exchanges, like Coinbase, Bittrex, and Binance, bundle demand. The auxiliary ecosystem services bundle reach to users. Notable investors and strong brands bundle user attention.</p>

<p>There’s no hope of stopping centralization, only containing it. Builders and investors would be wise to make sure they know which points of centralization will matter to their business. Or what centralization you are inadvertently going to collect by the power of conservation.</p>
