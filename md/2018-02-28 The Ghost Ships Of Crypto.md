# The Ghost Ships Of Crypto

I had to blink a few times. Looking at the cap table of a prospective investment, something jumped out at me. One of the primary backers of this fledgling startup was...another fledgling startup, itself no more than 12 months old. But this was not any young startup. It was a 2017-vintage-successful-ICO startup. Welcome to our new world, where the lines between company, open source software product, and venture investment firm blur together.

In these early moments, when it seems like all the infrastructure still needs to be built, it's easy to be optimistic. Unbounded upside is the very nature of the venture capital business — and when the whole world is seeking return for capital (and every asset class seems overpriced), this unbounded upside seems like a reasonable bet.

But let's turn our attention to the year 2025, and visit some of the projects from today. This world may seem far away—but the signs of its arrival are all around us. Consider news in just the last 48 hours:


When before have we had companies [dedicate 2/3rds of funds raised](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-investment-andreessen/blockchain-project-raises-61-million-from-andreessen-horowitz-u-s-hedge-fund-idUSKBN1FR1IX) to a venture fund for their own ecosystem?

**The Backbones**

Our first stop in 2025 is at one of the winning platform's headquarters. “Headquarters” is a bit of a misnomer here — while there is a huge physical presence, it's actually a collection of economic activity around this platform. There are direct employees of the original foundation. There are offices for early backers — now running multi-billion funds, based in the underpinning currency. Open community space where builders (affiliated, open source, and otherwise) work away. "Open" space in a relative sense: one must prove how they contribute to this platform for entry. (Another kind of “proof-of-work.”)

There's no centralized drumbeat like you saw back in 2017 on campuses like Google and Facebook; rather many disjointed efforts all tied together around a core economic activity. And this bustling physical space isn't the center of activity—merely a large node, with counterparts in Crypto-friendly world cities across the globe.

The annual meeting of this group is a frenzy of economic activity and platform integrations. Resources amongst members quickly circulate into the most promising new entrants in the ecosystem. If you squint, it almost looks like a Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder meeting — but where any folksiness is wiped away with Cypherpunk principles.

**The Centralized Actors**

The universe has an odd “conservation-of-centralization” effect (more on this another day)—every time some system is decentralized, new chokepoints are created that foster centralization.

We take the elevator to the 72nd floor—to visit one of these new central actors. The closest we could imagine to this business in 2017 was a centralized fiat-to-crypto gateway. The skyline quietly dominates the space, sprawling beneath our perch.

This business is hiring, sort of. More the way that a professional sports team scouts and selects, rather than growing. They have dominated their corner of this new universe so thoroughly that all the principals would stop working, dulled by their success and wealth, were their stronghold not so software-enabled and seemingly permanent.

We're one of few visitors—there's rarely any customers or even regulators—so much of the actual economic activity technically is registered far, far from here, so there's little to hide, see, or humans to serve. One can just image the hardware wallet in a vault, somewhere physically on Earth, seeing the dividends from this tiny wedge in a giant ecosystem.

But there are few people around, so we must continue on our journey.

**The Ghost Ships**

The weakest projects with resources were quickly picked off. “Activist investors” quickly arrived. Rather than cheap debt, they were armed to attack the network with a mix of influence and good software. Holders of the tokens quickly acquiesced to these more organized agents (or the forks they created), and the project either found itself on track, or too often the case, sacked of all it's resources and left to die until the last running node quit.

But some of the projects—funded in the halcyon days (2016-2018) never built their governance fully. The would-be-raiders trail went cold. This is where we are heading.

If we didn't know what we'd find here, the surroundings would be pleasant: a typical port in a semi-tropical island with favorable formation and taxation treatment. This is the technical “home” of the project. But this project's ship has sailed. Figuratively and we (literally) cannot find it in the harbor—too early to be regulated away by economic forces. Too slow to capture the wave of adoption and building that the winners did.

What remains is an empty shell of an entity. It's not clear who is paid or receives upside from the organization. In better times, the organization used their funds diversify into completely unrelated fields ([following](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/ripple-turns-investor-omni/) an early project called Ripple, and others).

It's become a developer platform without the developers. An investment fund without the investors. It's original backers either got out long ago, or may never see any economic value delivered to them.

The protocol lumbers on—not all the nodes ever seem to turn off.

Are they run by the ghost ship itself? Or run by someone else who still believes? Standing on the rocking jetty, the trail gone cold. We may never know.

So we will wait...waiting for someone to turn out the last light.
